Advanced Nav Cache
===================

Cache wp_nav_menu output in object cache. This is a simple "dropin" style plugin with no settings panel. Best used as an mu-plugin. Once in place, it caches all menus on the page, wherever they are called. 

This plugin is based on the ideas found in [Advanced Post Caching](https://github.com/Automattic/advanced-post-cache) plugin by [Automattic](http://automattic.com/).
